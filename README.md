# Invisible-person

Using this program a person can be invible in the camera using red colour cloth/plastics/paper/etc. I have made this project using numpy,time and open cv2.
This program first capture a image and store.When the camera sees a red colour the program just replace the part with the first image that was captured.
Before running install
#pip install numpy
#pip install cv2
#pip install time
Thank you❤️
